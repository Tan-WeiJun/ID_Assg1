This assignment is on creating a Portfolio to attract potential headhunters from the IT industry to reach out to me.
<br>


## What makes my Portfolio special?<br>
My page are easily accessible from the menu and has a very technological feel. <br>
The page is filled with information, however these informations are broken down into small parts for the users to read easily.<br>
I added some micro-interaction in the page such as the change of colours when hovering on the menu.<br>
Interested employers can also send an email/contact me through this page. 

### Features:

- __Main Page__: Display my portfolio with what I am currently doing. this page shows my interests, skills, and competencies(soft skills) in the IT industry.
- __Education Page__: Shows the history of my education background. Allow potential employers to know my educational background.
- __Work Page__: Shows my past work experience.
- __Projects Page__: Shows my recent projects. Allow potential employers to view my recent projects
- __Contact Page__: Displays my email address and mobile no. The page also includes a portion where users can send a form to my email address. Potential employers can contact me seamlessly on this page by just filling a form.


### Design:
- __Colour Scheme__: Different shades of blue with white as these colours are often related to IT
- __Background__: chosen a background that is related to IT and matched the colour scheme.
- __Layout__: I try to keep the layout simple for users to explore the page. The layout should also be pleasant for the eye; without too much information at one go.


### Software used:
- __html__ :the skeleton of the page; where all the information are at.
- __CSS__: The different styles are stored to create a pleasant looking page.
- __Adobe XD__: Used to create wireframe.
