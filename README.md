This assignment is on creating a Portfolio to attract potential headhunters from the IT industry to reach out to me.
<br>


##What makes my Portfolio special?<br>
My page are easily accessible from the menu and has a very technological feel. <br>
The page is filled with information, however these informations are broken down into small parts for the users to read easily.<br>
I added some micro-interaction in the page such as the change of colours when hovering on the menu.<br>
Interested employers can also send an email/contact me through this page. 

Features:
<ul>
 <li>**Main Page**:Display my portfolio with what I am currently doing. this page shows my interests, skills, and competencies(soft skills) in the IT industry.</li>
 <li>Education Page:Shows the history of my education background. Allow potential employers to know my educational background.</li>
 <li>Work Page:Shows my past work experience.</li>
 <li>Projects Page:Shows my recent projects. Allow potential employers to view my recent projects </li>
 <li>Contact Page:Displays my email address and mobile no. The page also includes a portion where users can send a form to my email address. Potential employers can contact me seamlessly on this page by just filling a form.</li>
</ul>

Design:
<ul>
 <li>Colour Scheme: Different shades of blue with white as these colours are often related to IT</li>
 <li>Background: chosen a background that is related to IT and matched the colour scheme.</li>
 <li>Layout: I try to keep the layout simple for users to explore the page. The layout should also be pleasant for the eye; without too much information at one go.</li>
</ul>

Software used:
